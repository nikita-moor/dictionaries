### [Victionarium Latinum (2020)][1] v1.0

Latin-Latin dictionary made of Latin-language Wiktionary.

Wiktionary seems to be an interesting source, but in fact it is a nightmare to parse wiki-text because of multiple malformed articles and non-maintained templates.


**Download** from [GitHub][20].
