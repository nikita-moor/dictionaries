This release contains updates to several dictionaries:

* Gesner1749 v1.0
* Lewis1890 v1.1
* Poliachev2002 v1.1
* Reyher1712 v0.2
* Zepic1941 v1.1

Some of these changes are no more than improved styles, where content of other dictionaries was fixed in many places. Anyway, we consider these changes to be not significant.
