### [Diccionario Español-Griego-Latín, López Pozo (1997)][1] v1.0

Text was proofreaded and multiple errors were fixed, particularly incorrect splitting into paragraphs, flections formatting, and Greek script decoding.

The dictionary is ready for everyday use, but its Greek part still requires scrupulous correction.
