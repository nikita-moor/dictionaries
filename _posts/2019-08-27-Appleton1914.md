[Appleton1914][2] v1.1:

Bug-fix release for users of GoldenDict Mobile: dictionaries in this application can interfere each other, if they describe the same elements, e.g. dictionary headers, but apply different styles to them.

We are going to publish fixes for StarDict versions of other dictionaries, but it will take some time. Please, inform us, if you encounter with an oddly looking layout or incorrect appearance in our dictionaries.

Desktop version of GoldenDict does restrict styles to their own dictionary, but not in case of StarDict, so using any other format (we recommend Slob), your are free from such a bug.

This release contains only StarDict file, other format can be downloaded from the [previous release][3].
