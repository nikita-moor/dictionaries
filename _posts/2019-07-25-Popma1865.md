---

Dicitonary ["De differentiis verborum" (Popma, 1865)][2] is still far from completeness:

* index of keys is incomplete
* iv-spelling: ask for "mvlier", not "mulier"
* automatic normalization failed in most cases

This work-in-progress release includes embedded styles (no need for setting [custom styles][5]) and improved image-viewer; margins of the images were cut; several articles were transcribed (e.g. "bellus").

Still looking for a coauthor or PM ready to manage public transcribe project.

Only [Slob format][3] for [GoldenDict][4]. [Download][1].
