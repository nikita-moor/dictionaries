### [Latin synonyms, Dumesnil (1819)][1] v1.2

Dictionary was updated to include convenient image viewer and embed styles, so users do not need setting up "custom styles" anymore.

* new: mobile formats
* new: images were clipped
* changed: embedded styles; custom styles not needed now
* changed: image viewer

Many thanks to anonymous person provided images with clipped margins.

Headwords are still unaltered, so, looking for a verb, use its infinitive form. Other parts of speech should be compatible with Hunspell, if not medieval spelling is used.


### [A Latin Dictionary, Lewis & Short (1879)][2] v1.2

This release fixing missing headwords, other changes are cosmetic.

* fixed: headwords with numbers
* changed: ordered lists (α)…(ω)
* changed: paragraphs split on mdash
