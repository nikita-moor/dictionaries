First release of the dicitonary ["Novus linguae et eruditionis Romanae thesaurus" (Gesner, 1749)][2].

Working on this project, the main difficulty was translating images from JPEG2000 (jp2) to TIFF G4 format for reducing size of the dicitonary file (from 3.0 to 0.5 Gb). I would like to share approach I went to after many tests:

* JPEG2000 image is changed to greyscale palette, resized 2x bigger and saved to PNG format.
* Using [Local Adaptive Binarization][5] tool implementing Wolf's algorithm, image is converted to black-and-white PNG.
* PNG is resized x2 smaller, and saved to TIFF G4 format using ImageMagick tool (it is better then XnView MP).

Only [Slob format][3] for [GoldenDict][4]. [Download][1].
