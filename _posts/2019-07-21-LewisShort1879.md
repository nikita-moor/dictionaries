[LewisShort1879][2] v1.0:

Latin-English dictionary by Lewis & Short is very famous. However, I was able to find only one offline version of it (in StarDict format), which was not well formatted. So, I made my own version. Original files in TEI format have multiple problems and I was interested in simply acceptable result, so my edition is not excellent.

Only [Slob format][3] ([GoldenDict][4], [Aard 2][5]) this time. Please, [contact us][6] if you need files for another shell.
