### [Simpson1959][3] v1.0

Simple and nice dictionary for learners of Latin courses. It was completely transcribed by one person, amazing!

### [Lewis1890][1] v1.0

Very popular Latin-English dictionary we could recommend to every Latin student. We tried to make a good-looking dictionary pleasant to use.

### [LewisShort1879][2] v1.1

Updated version of our dictionary published earlier this month, and older brother of the previous dictionary. Some problems with indentation of sub-definitions and articles without content were fixed.

Advice: if one day you decide to transcribe a dictionary, take a deep look at these two dictionaries of Lewis. They were encoded and marked up in TEI format with multiple errors. Try do not repeat these mistakes.
