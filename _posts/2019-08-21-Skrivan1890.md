Updated version of Latin-Czech dictionary [Skrivan1890][2]:

Nothing changed inside, so users of GoldenDict could continue using previous XDFX version, or switch to new Slob format and forget about setting up custom styles.

New formats for mobile users: StarDict, MDict and Slob.

Also, we start publishing our dictionaries in TEI format designed mainly for interoperability. It can preserve almost all information from transcribed book and be transformed to final formats used in computer shells.

**Download** from [GitHub][1].
