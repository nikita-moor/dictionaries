<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>On this web-site you will find dictionaries I made during my study of Latin language.</p>

<p>Dictionaries are encoded into XDXF format, and intended to be used on computer. This format is supported by a dozen of dictionary shells, such a GoldenDict (Windows, Linux, MacOS) or Alpus (Android); see full list of compatible applications on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The main sections of the site are <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link dictionaries.md %}">list of dictionaries</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/docs.md %}">recommendations for their use</a> with GoldenDict.</p>
