<h1>Salve</h1>

<p>On this web-site you will find dictionaries I made during my study of Latin language. List of the available wordbooks could be found in the particular <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link dictionaries.md %}">section</a>.</p> 

<p>Dictionaries are encoded into XDXF format, and intended to be used on computer. This format is supported by desktop and mobile dictionary applications. See <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/docs.md %}">documentation</a> for additional information.</p>

<p>I am open for cooperation. If you know how to use such software as <a href="http://unpaper.berlios.de/">unpaper</a> or <a href="http://scantailor.sourceforge.net/">Scan Tailor</a>, you could help improving scans. Of course, transcript of the dictionary articles would be much appreciated. If you prefer to work independently, I could add links to your Latin dictionaries into the collection.</p>

<p>In any case feel free to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %}">contact me</a> or create an issue in <a href="https://github.com/nikita-moor/latin-dictionary">github repository</a>.</p>
