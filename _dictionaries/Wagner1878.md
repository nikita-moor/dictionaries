## Sources

This dictionary bases on the French edition published in 1878 year (with triple index) and the transcription being made for Gutenberd project (2017–now):
    
1. Wagner, Franz S. J.; Borgnet, Auguste. _Lexicon latinum seu Corpus Phraseologiæ._ Brugis, 1878. URL: <https://archive.org/details/LexiconLatinum> \[Accessed 4 March 2019\].
1. On-going transcribe project. URL: <https://www.pgdp.net/c/project.php?id=projectID5b3d9b5f27ee1> \[Accessed 4 March 2019\].


## Usage guidelines

Format and structure of the dictionary hardly fit the XDXF format, so this _draft_ edition fails test agains DTD schema and probably will diverge more from the XDXF format in future editions. This file was tested only in [GoldenDict][1] and could be incompatible with other dictionary shells. It is strongly adviced using additional styles for GoldenDict (hide/show full article), see [article-style.css](article-style.css) file.

[GoldenDict][1] dictionary application supports normalization of input words (pæne > paene; prāva > pravus). We recommend using ["Latin spelling and hyphenation dictionaries"][2] in combination with this dictionary.

## work plans

This draft bases on the WIP version of the transcript and I am not going to do any improvements till the 1st part of the dictionary be finished.

Current state of the transcript project (2018-03-04):

* Parts 1–2: Formatting round (F2)
* Parts 3–18: Profreading round (P2–P3)

By the most optimistic variant, Part 1 will be released in 2–3 months, though it completely depends on the proofreading team.

Anyway, I am open for suggestions about formatting, or noticed errors in the text.
