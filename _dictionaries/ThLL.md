International project Thesaurus linguae Latinae aims to build a lexicon covering all surviving Latin texts from the earliest times down to AD 600. To the date, it contains words from A to R (with some missing intervals).

This is an **online dictionary**, all articles will be downloaded from the Internet. Think of it as an alternative interface in addition to the [standard one][2], with such advantages as morphology search (Hunspell) and integration with GoldenDict.


## Download

Current version is [v1.0 (August 23, 2020)][1]. File in Slob format has been prepared for desktop GoldenDict, mobile dictionaries are not supported because the text is too small to read it from smartphone screens.
