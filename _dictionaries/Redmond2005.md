Dr. Walter Redmond (lat. Gualterius Redmond) is a prominent scholar who reads courses of Logic and Philosophy entirely in Latin. Examples of his speechs and books:

* [Rubii psychologismi et nominalismi refutatio][5] (video)
* [Philosophia Latine Docta][6] (see 'Commentationes')

Sometimes, his dictionary is referenced as "Glossarium Philosophicum", even though it contains vocabulary from various fields of knowledge.

This dictionary provides translations from **English** to **Latin** language of more than 10,000 words and phrases. According to Thomas McCarthy (see Sources), it was compiled in 2005. Author's website ([http://upaep.mx/micrositios/glossarium/][4]) does not function since the end of 2017.

# States and limitations

Dictionary contains many sentences, which are difficult to index, so we advice using 'Search Pane' in GoldenDict (menu View\|Search Pane):

Redmond uses capitalized letters to show correct stress (accent), such as "malEdicus". We replaced them with accented characters, "malédicus", but it can corrupt some words ("Africa" > "áfrica"). [Inform us][7] if you encounter errors.
