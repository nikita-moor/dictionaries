Thesaurus with short explanations of the words in **Latin**, and following extensive quotations from classic authors.

Text of the dictionary was partially transcribed—only first sentence or several words—by the team of Dr. Wilhelm Kühlmann from Heidelberg University. The remaining parts of the articles should be read from the attached scanned pages.

Addendum ["Latinitatis Index Etymologicus"][3] is not included into our version. If you find it important, please, contact us.


## Download

Current version [v0.9][2] (July 30, 2019) is not final (see section _States and limitations_), but close to the final release.

## States and limitations

1. Text in TEI format missing correct markup of some headwords, so about 900 of the articles are excluded from our digital version. Most of them are redirections, such as:
> **ACRITAS**, **ACRITVDO**, **ACRITER**, _Vid._ ACER, Adi.
1. If an article contains several headwords, transcribers regularly marked only first one. For that reason, articles in our dictionary are indexed only by the first key.
1. Author of the dictionary, Johann Gesner, used iv-spelling of the headwords (majusculae). Keys were translated to iu-spelling, but still are not fully [compatible with Hunspell][102]. Looking for "vivo", one need to query "uiuo".
1. Articles in the paper book are arranged not in alphabetical, but etymological order. So is in the attached scanned pages.
1. Almost every article is accompanied with literal translations of the term in Greek, so they could be used for building Greek index of the book. (Contact us if you think it would be useful.)
