**English-Latin** dictionary. Current state of the transcript (2019-05-21) does not allow to detect dictionary structure correctly, so in many cases formatting is incorrect. I am not going to fix it until the transcript be finished.

Another digital edition of this dictionary was made by [Johan Winge](https://github.com/Alatius), his version is available on-line on the [web-site Latinitium][2] and should be recommended to all users.

To the date, this XDXF version is the only known offline edition, so it could be used taking into consideration afore-referenced defects.

For download see [Release][101] section; for developer version and source files see [github repository][1].
