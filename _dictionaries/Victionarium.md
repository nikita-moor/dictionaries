# States and limitations

Dictionary contains only definitions of the words, links to Latin-language Wikipedia, and images. Etymology (Notatio) sections were parsed (see [github repository][3]), but we found them not useful and did not include into the final edition. Sections _Formae alia_, _Synonyma_, _Dictiones collatae_, and similar seem interesting and may be included into the following releases.

Images were reduced to 512 px to make the file of reasonable size.

Sign "âˆš" marks main definitions of the words, see [Victionarium][4] for other symbols and abbreviations.
